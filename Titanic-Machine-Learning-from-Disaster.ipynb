    "## Titanic Disaster\n",
    "\n",
    "###  1. Problem definition\n",
    "        Use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.\n",
    "        We're going to use classification model. We have two posibilities Survival (1) and not (0).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "###  2. Data\n",
    "        We have train and test data. Into train data we're going to make validation data (0.2) to check our results before we compare our prediction with test data. \n",
    "        \n",
    "###  3. Evaluation\n",
    "    Our score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict. This is known as accuracy.\n",
    "    survival\tSurvival\t0 = No, 1 = Yes - target\n",
    "    We're going to submit csv file with exactly 418 entries plus a header row. \n",
    "    The file should have exactly 2 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "    PassengerId (sorted in any order)\n",
    "    Survived (contains your binary predictions: 1 for survived, 0 for deceased)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Features\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ** pclass\tTicket class\t1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd\n",
    "    ** sex\tSex\t\n",
    "    ** Age\tAge in years\t\n",
    "    ** sibsp\t# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic\t\n",
    "    ** parch\t# of parents / children aboard the Titanic\t\n",
    "    ** ticket\tTicket number\t\n",
    "    ** fare\tPassenger fare\t\n",
    "    ** cabin\tCabin number\t\n",
    "    ** embarked\tPort of Embarkation\tC = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Explanation of features:\n",
    "    pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)\n",
    "    1st = Upper\n",
    "    2nd = Middle\n",
    "    3rd = Lower\n",
    "\n",
    "    age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5\n",
    "\n",
    "    sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\n",
    "    Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister\n",
    "    Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)\n",
    "\n",
    "    parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...\n",
    "    Parent = mother, father\n",
    "    Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson\n",
    "    Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Modeling\n",
    "    We're going to use classification model, idk yet which one, but I will check.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Experimenting\n",
    "    We have to get the best accuracy then we will work on that"
